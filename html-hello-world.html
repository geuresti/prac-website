      <p> This is my first section. The difference between a section <br />
        and a div tag is that a section has a header, footer, or other <br />
        documentation while a div simply divides a page into different <br />
        components for the sake of styling </p>

    <h3> What is Lorem Ipsum? </h3>
    <p>
      Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing <br />
      and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the <br />
      industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when <br />
      an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it <br />
      to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five <br />
      centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, <br />
      remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the <br />
      1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem <br />
      Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing <br />
      software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.<br />

      Why do we use it? <br />
      It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by <br />
      the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point<br />
      of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal <br />
      distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, <br />
      content here', making it look like readable English. Many <br />
      desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem <br />
      Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' <br />
      will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various <br />
      versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, <br />
      sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
